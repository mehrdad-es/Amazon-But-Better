Standing at six foot four inches and with deeply grotesque facial scars, he instilled fear as Hitler's top executioner of death. This thoroughly researched book takes you into the twisted psyche of one of the most vile and murdering figures of the Nazi regime.Ernst Kaltenbrunner was a high-ranking Austrian SS official, a driven anti-Semite, and fanatical Hitler loyalist. Rising quickly in the ranks, he was personally appointed as Chief of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) — which included the Gestapo, Kripo, and SD — by Himmler himself. Under Kaltenbrunner's command, the genocide of Jews greatly intensified as the process of extermination throughout the occupied countries picked up incredible pace.Over seventy years later, Arthur Birago stumbles upon a mind-blowing forty-page letter by Kaltenbrunner that was hidden away in a safe of the State Archive of Upper Austria. Written secretly in Nuremberg prison while waiting to be executed, the letter is addressed to his children and was smuggled out in the bra of a female visitor.It's a sentimental and mendacious account of his childhood memories and upbringing in the countryside, from where he climbed to the zenith of power in the Nazi ranks and ultimately enjoyed the privilege of having direct access to Hitler.

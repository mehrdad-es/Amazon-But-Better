A Little Bit Broken: A Memoir Kindle Edition|by Roz Weston (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|NATIONAL BESTSELLERIt never gets better, but it does get easier. That's the first thing Roz says to anyone who asks him for advice. Anyone who's fighting like hell, just hanging on or putting the pieces back together. When you're broken, fixed becomes an obsession. Roz is a multi-platform entertainer and storyteller who hosts three shows a day and sleeps five hours a night. On The Roz & Mocha Show, ET Canada Live and Entertainment Tonight Canada Roz built an audience and turned them into family. But as with most families, there is just some shit we don't talk about. From growing up in a small town to getting lost, drunk and terrified in New York while interning for The Howard Stern Show; from finding comfort in the arms and beds of strangers to kicking an opioid addiction he didn't know he had; from broken bones to broken hearts and a broken marriage. From navigating grief and guilt following the devastating loss of his father to persevering in the face of an ongoing and private battle with his own body. All is shared in Roz's disarming signature blend of blunt truth and humour.A Little Bit Broken is a deeply personal and inspiring account of self-forgiveness, redemption and recovering from bad choices—because let's face it, the reason we make bad choices is that they usually feel really good. And Roz has made them all. "This book is the whole story I've never shared before. . . . This is the shit we don’t talk about. Welcome to the family."

The Battle of the Narrow Seas: The History of Light Coastal Forces in the Channel and North Sea, 1939–1945 Kindle Edition|by Peter Scott (Author), Antony Hichens (Introduction) Format: Kindle Edition|A WWII Royal Navy commander recounts the struggle to control the narrow seas between Britain and the rest of Europe throughout the war.A Motor Torpedo Boat Commander in the Second World War, Sir Peter Scott—the son of explorer Robert Scott—was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his bravery in battle. Combining his own experience with extensive military research, he tells the story of the wide-ranging naval conflict against the Germans, fought in the congested waters of the Channel and the southern North Sea.Actions against convoys and E-boats, often under the shadows of French cliffs; an impossible sortie against Scharnhorst and Gneisenau as they ran the gauntlet through the Straits in February 1942; the attack on St Nazaire; and the defensive and offensive roles taken on by MTBs during the D-Day landings are just some of the events covered in the book. The bravery of the crews of these small ships became legendary. As the War dragged on, their exploits helped to raise the morale of the nation.

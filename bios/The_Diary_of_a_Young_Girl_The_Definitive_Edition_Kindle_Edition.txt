The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition Kindle Edition|by Anne Frank (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|The Diary of a Young Girl, often known as the Anne Frank Diary, is a collection of entries from Anne Frank's Dutch-language diary, which she recorded while a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family evacuated their house in Amsterdam and went into hiding in 1942, when Nazis occupied Holland. Anne Frank died of typhus at the Bergen-Belsen detention camp in 1945, after the family was captured in 1944. Anne Frank kept a diary throughout this time, recording vivid recollections of her events. Her tale is a fascinating commentary on human tenacity and weakness, as well as a riveting Self-Portrait of a sensitive and energetic young lady whose promise was sadly cut short. Miep gies were able to retrieve the diary.

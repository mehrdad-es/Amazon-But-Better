He presented the disturbing finding to his mother, Julie, who inquired about the skull to her husband, Herb. He told her that the skeleton belonged to his late father, an anaesthesiologist, who used it for his research. He said he didn’t know what to do with it, so he buried it in the back garden. Julie believed him.Over the course of eighteen-months, Julie became increasingly concerned and frightened by her husband's mood swings and erratic behaviour. In June 1996, whilst Herb was on vacation, she granted police full access to her family’s eighteen-acre home. Within ten days of the search, investigators uncovered the remains of eleven bodies. Once news of the findings at Fox Hollow Farm was broadcast, Herb disappeared.Herb Baumeister would later be alleged to have killed at least nine more men along the Interstate 70 between Indiana and Ohio, and coined the “I-70 Strangler”. It is entirely possible that he was one of the most prolific serial killers in history.You Think You Know Me is a chilling account of Herb Baumeister and one of the most mysterious true crime stories in American history.

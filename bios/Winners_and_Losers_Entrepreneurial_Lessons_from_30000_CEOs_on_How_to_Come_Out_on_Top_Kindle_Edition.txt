Winners and Losers: Entrepreneurial Lessons from 30,000 CEOs on How to Come Out on Top Kindle Edition|by Don Schmincke (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|Struggling to be an entrepreneur? Forget what you know. Success is not about how to win . . . It’s about how to lose.With thousands of books and courses on entrepreneurship, why aren’t there more successful entrepreneurs? The answer is simple—we have been teaching it all wrong. In Winners and Losers, award-winning speaker Don Schmincke uses research from his many anthropological expeditions across the world, scientific data, and his experience training over thirty thousand CEOs to uncover the truth. Instead of looking at what successful entrepreneurs did right, Schmincke looks at what happened before their successes. What he found was that their paths were littered with mistakes, misguided assumptions, and major losses. Could the key to their successful entrepreneurship actually lie in their failures?Unlike entrepreneurship books that focus on how to win, Schmincke deviates from the status quo and reveals that the real secret is in how to lose—powerfully. True success arises from the inevitable losses that come with risky ventures.With a straightforward, humorous, and often politically incorrect approach, Winners and Losers offers anyone with entrepreneurial dreams unique management methods and scientific models to help build a framework for success.Moments of despair birth real entrepreneurship. It’s time to embrace the loss.

Pride amid Prejudice (Modern Military Memoirs) Kindle Edition|by Necole Belanger (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|Chief Warrant Officer Necole Belanger created a professional persona that was no-nonsense and highly put-together—even perfect. But the truth was much more complex.Necole’s story is a tale of two lives, the CWO raised in a military family, and the woman coming to terms with her sexuality and her identity, in a time where the two could not co-exist. A lesbian member of the military police during the LGBTQ Purge in the Canadian Armed Forces, Necole would achieve success and promotion in her military career despite a near-constant struggle for identity.But the higher she rose in rank within the Canadian Armed Forces, the less her voice was heard. When she should have had the most influence on the organization, she had none. When she’d finally earned a seat at the table, no one listened to what she had to say. Her life was dedicated to an institution that didn’t return her loyalty.The result?Depression and drinking and a downward spiral, all hidden behind a mask. And then the courage to be honest, with others and herself, and put the pieces of her life back together again.Pride Amid Prejudice is the story of one woman’s struggle to find a voice for herself in a world determined to silence her. A journey of self-discovery through adversity, of resilience in the face of discrimination, and pride amid prejudice.

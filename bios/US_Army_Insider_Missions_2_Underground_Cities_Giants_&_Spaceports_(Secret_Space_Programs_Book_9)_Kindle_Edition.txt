US Army Insider Missions 2: Underground Cities, Giants & Spaceports (Secret Space Programs Book 9) Kindle Edition|by Michael Salla (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|It has become clear JP, a soldier currently serving within the US Army, is part of a covert disclosure initiative to expose the public to the diverse projects involving “non-human intelligence” and exotic technologies that are known to the US military. However, in true military fashion this is being done in a way that maintains plausible deniability. As you will discover in Volume 2, almost all of JP’s missions involve “non-human intelligence” based on Earth in underwater or underground locations. This is a marked shift from Volume 1, which contained an even mix of off-planet and Earth-based missions.After the publication of Volume 1 of this book series, JP reported that several officers approached him privately to congratulate him on the good job he has been doing and even asked for his autograph. Given that JP is only an enlisted serviceman, such recognition speaks volumes about the covert disclosure initiative that the US Army/Air Force is conducting through him. JP’s mission updates are essential first-hand eyewitness accounts by an active military serviceman describing what is happening in some of the most highly classified projects being conducted by the US concerning non-human intelligence and technologies.

Rules of the Road: Breakdowns on the Musical Highway Kindle Edition|by Stephen Donnelly (Author), Brendan McNally (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|“Captures the untamed spirit of the 1990s indie music scene better than anything I’ve ever read. I was instantly transported back to the sights, sounds and smells of a time I thought I’d forgotten: the endless parade of bands in vans and pubs and clubs—and all the offbeat personalities and insane situations that defined the heyday of alt-rock and made it so much fun, whether you were in a band or just a fan. Somebody needed to document this era, and Rules of the Road gets it just right.” - Slo’ Tom Stewart, Furnaceface“A raw look at what it’s like to be a rock and roll everyman. The ups, downs, and existential angst.”- Brent Donnelly, author of Alpha Trader and 50 Trades In 50 Weeks; brotherTo say that the band Jimmy George were a hot ticket in Ottawa’s emerging indie music scene of the 1990s wouldn’t really do them justice.Singer J would get things going every Sunday night by grabbing the microphone and saying, “We’re Jimmy George!” To which guitarist Spike would shout to the crowd, “And you suck!”Rules of the Road is the story of a musician and a band that’s part of the Canadian musical legacy. Bands were linking local scenes into regional ones, before going on to form a national indie scene bopping around Canada in different little tour buses and vans, playing different video games along the way.Rules of the Road is a raucous romp through one part of the 90s Canadian indie music scene, in a town some think of as a place that fun forgot. Here’s the story of one of the players who played his part (and bass) while going on his very own musical ride, in a little green tour bus, along with the kings of the Duke, Jimmy George.- From the Foreword by McNally

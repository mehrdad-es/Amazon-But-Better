Vietnam Diary: A Memoir for my Posterity Kindle Edition|by Lanny Starr (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|"Greetings from the President."I could hardly believe what I was reading. I had just been drafted into the US Army, the last thing I expected. It was certainly not what my parents or fiancee wanted to hear. Enclosed in these pages are my personal experiences from a tour served in Vietnam during the war. This book is written in my own words; these are my memories of life on the battlefront in a land foreign to me. I hope this recounting will help my family and posterity comprehend the great sacrifices made by brave and frightened soldiers in wartime. These sacrifices have protected freedoms we tend to take for granted. This is my true story.

Icarus of Brooklyn: A Spiritual Quest Gone Wrong Kindle Edition|by Matthew Alper (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|At some point in our early youth, we all come to the realization that living things ourselves included die. From the moment Matthew Alper reached this conclusion, it became his life quest to understand the nature of death. Was it a permanent ending or, as so many believed, the advent of a new beginning? Only God, it seemed, could answer such lofty questions, and so it became Matthew's chief aim to acquire knowledge of a higher power. Thus begins the personal journey that is Icarus of Brooklyn: A Spiritual Quest Gone Wrong.From early childhood Matthew devotes himself to the investigation of all things magical, mystical and philosophical in search of ultimate meaning. Only Matthew is no Buddha. The product of Jewish bohemian Brooklynites, Matthew is impish and irreverent.This is a classic quest tale, but with humor, unexpected twists and an unconventional resolution. Evolving from a hopeful innocent to cynical and skeptical adolescent, Matthew begins using psychedelic drugs to hasten his quest for transcendence only to have a bad LSD trip that precipitates a tragic descent into madness, suicide and hospitalization. Like the Greek tale of Icarus, it is the story of a man who will stop at nothing to acquire a glimpse into the Heavens only to be burned for his hubris and wanton recklessness. Through a fortunate twist of fate, Matthew is restored to find redemption in a life of contentment without spiritual certitude.Readers who have contemplated the notions of a spiritual realm, an eternal soul and an infinite God and then not found it will find a kindred voice in Icarus. Told through a series of dialogues and anecdotes which range from the sublime to the ridiculous, Icarus is as humorous and entertaining as it is poignant and profound.

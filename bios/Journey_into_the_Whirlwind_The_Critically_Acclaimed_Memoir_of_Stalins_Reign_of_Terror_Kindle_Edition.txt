Journey into the Whirlwind: The Critically Acclaimed Memoir of Stalin's Reign of Terror Kindle Edition|by Eugenia Semenovna Ginzburg (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|A woman’s true account of eighteen years as a Soviet prisoner: “Not even Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich matches it.”—The New York Times Book ReviewIn the late 1930s, Eugenia Ginzburg was a wife and mother, a schoolteacher and writer, and a longtime loyal Communist Party member. But like millions of others during Stalin’s reign of terror, she was arrested—on trumped-up charges of being a Trotskyist terrorist counter-revolutionary—and sentenced to prison.With sharp detail and an indefatigable spirit, Ginzburg recounts her arrest and the eighteen harrowing years she endured in Soviet prisons and labor camps, including two in solitary confinement. Her memoir is “a compelling personal narrative of survival” (The New York Times Book Review)—and one of the most important documents of Stalin’s brutal regime.“Deeply significant…intensely personal and passionately felt.”—Time“Probably the best account that has ever been published of…the prison and camp empire of the Stalin era.”—Book WorldTranslated by Paul Stevenson and Max Hayward

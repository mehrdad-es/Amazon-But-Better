Bohemian Ghosts: A Memoir Kindle Edition|by Dewey Paul Moffitt (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|True tales of a modern day psychedelic adventurer in the vein of Kerouac, Wolfe, Bukowski, and Robbins. Musician and promoter Dewey Paul Moffitt has penned a rollicking memoir of a life spent following his heart into a wild world of sex, drugs, rock and roll, celebrity friendships, Rainbow Gatherings, biker gangs, hitchhiking, UFO sightings, and, finally, true love. Fueled by not much more than luck, fate, and karma, at 18, Moffitt left his record store job in Boca Raton and, through a serendipitous path of self discovery and lite mayhem, soon found himself working for rock impresario Bill Graham, the legendary promoter behind the Grateful Dead scene—living the high life alongside rock’s elite one day and narrowly escaping disaster in crime-worn East Oakland the next. Through it all, Moffitt yearned to find the right woman who would ease his lonely journey as he worked day and night to learn the music business from the ground floor up. Rising through the ranks of major concert production, Moffitt has worked with a long and impressive list of employers and partners as a festival and concert promoter, audio engineer, and talent buyer.This memoir chronicles the authors many adventures in the psychedelic Grateful Dead and Jam Band scene (Allmans, Phish, Panic, Blues Traveler, Pfunk). From his parking lot days to working backstage, the book examines how that wild counter-culture world impacted his early adult years and allowed him to discover his passion for the concert industry. Included are wonderful, if sometimes embarrassing, tales that will interest you as music fans and fellow travelers, and there are even some shocking and juicy romantic stories you are certain to enjoy.

Murphy’s Logic: Insights from 45 Years in the News Business Kindle Edition|by Steve Murphy (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|After a lifetime of reporting news and showcasing the opinions of others, Steve Murphy is finally ready to express his own opinions about the things he’s done and the people he’s met along the way.Murphy’s Logic delves without reservation into Murphy’s informal education in broadcasting, beginning as a sixteen-year-old kid who “just wanted to be on the radio.” Mixing memoir and commentary, Murphy writes about his adventures covering significant regional, national, and international events and offers unique insight into the more than five thousand interviews he has conducted over his forty-five-year career—with five prime ministers, thirty-five premiers, and numerous historic figures and celebrities.Both candid and brutally honest, Murphy’s Logic examines, for the first time, two high-profile occasions during which Murphy unintentionally—and uncomfortably—became part of the stories he was covering. He offers pointed views on how the proliferation of social media has dramatically affected the news industry, and challenges readers to think critically about the media they consume.With more than forty images, including a colour photo insert, and featuring a foreword by Ian Hanomansing, Murphy’s Logic peers behind the curtain of the news business and offers readers rare insight into what Steve Murphy really thinks.

Becoming Her Kindle Edition|by Eva Graxton (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|“Your father is a sociopath.”Her therapist’s words reveal the awful truth.But they also offer Eva the key to breaking free.Convinced that every negative situation—even childhood sexual abuse at the hands of her brother and others—results directly from her choices, Eva rejects any suggestion that she’s a victim of trauma.Her narcissist father has trained her to embrace this mindset as he controls her every decision, including who she marries—a man just like him.Trapped in this abusive marriage for nearly ten years, Eva seeks therapy to learn how she can be a better wife.Instead, her therapist’s insights guide her in exposing a lifetime of gaslighting. But even as she uncovers the truth about her father’s manipulation, she struggles to see anything but a loving father who wants the best for her.Eva must unlearn the dangerous “truths” she thinks will keep her safe and accept that her father and husband are incapable of loving her.But does God really want her to forsake her parents and spouse in order to forge a new life and heal?Eva has only herself, her therapist, and God on her side as she makes terrifying leaps of faith into an unfamiliar world.In Becoming Her, join Eva on her courageous journey of healing and hope.~Trigger warning~Child Abuse / Sexual AbuseGaslighting / Mental Abuse

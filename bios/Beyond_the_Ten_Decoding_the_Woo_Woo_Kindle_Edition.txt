Beyond the Ten, Decoding the Woo Woo Kindle Edition|by Dana Sardano (Author, Editor), Angela DiMarco (Illustrator) Format: Kindle Edition|“Dana captivates the reader once again with her deep insight and practical approach to spirituality and healing. This book breaks down concepts in a real-life tangible manner, and her gift of storytelling leaves you eager to learn 'what happens next?!' I highly recommend this book for those navigating through their own personal journey.” ~Cristen GrajedaBeyond the Ten, Decoding the Woo Woo, is a Part II (of sorts) to Ten Recommandments for Personal Empowerment for two reasons—one, Dana’s “awakening” primarily came in two parts and two, she wanted to demystify the whole concept of spirituality through her own personal experience of “awakening”.What Dana has learned up until now is that true personal empowerment, self-healing, and self-actualization come in layers. Also, each layer comes with its own trials and tribulations, its own flavor of how it appears before you, requires its own new and improved skill set taken from the previous layer, and its own brand of rewards once those trials and tribulations are overcome.This process appears mystical and magical to those who have not yet uncovered the formulas and patterns, but when we begin to peel back the layers of self-protection and reverse our irrational belief systems and toxic behavioral patterns, we begin to see with more clarity and understand the steps that led us to our present circumstances and the path of our desired outcome(s) becomes illuminated by our awareness.If you find yourself beginning to question all that you’ve been conditioned to believe about yourself and the world around you, then you are ready to unlock your patterns and uncover your formula. As Dana has mentioned repeatedly in Ten Recommandments for Personal Empowerment, she is always happy to help shine the light and offer perspective through the lens of HER story, but at the end of the day, only you know what’s best for you, and if you are aware and willing and most importantly honest with yourself, listen to your inner wisdom because after all, this is YOUR life—this is YOUR story.

Old Pilot Bold Pilot Kindle Edition|by Blaine Bjarnarson (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|The adage that there are no old, bold pilots is in dispute.Blaine Bjarnarson is indeed the survivor of some amazing flying events, and tells his story from the left seat of his favourite airplane—a Twin Otter on floats. We learn early in this book’s 226 illustrated pages that Bjarnarson is good at what he does because he gets called back from all the bush operators he flies for; those in La Ronge, Saskatchewan, in Yellowknife, even in Croatia, the Middle East and the Maldives.His stint with Kenn Borek Air has our pilot transporting a DHC-6 across the globe to the Maldives. Later, while testing an innovation that flies only in ground effect, it brings our hero to a near-death experience that should have grounded him for life.Writing this book from his own oasis in Thailand, Bjarnarson awaits the end of COVID to get airborne once more to add a final chapter to his amazing life - and bringing those chapters to you in Old Pilot Bold Pilot.Old Pilot Bold Pilot is a heartwarming and inspiring tale of one man's lifelong love of adventure. It's a story that will stay with you long after you've finished reading it.

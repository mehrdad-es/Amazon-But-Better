Tucker Kindle Edition|by Chadwick Moore (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|For tens of millions of Americans, Tucker Carlson was long the only voice on cable news providing a counternarrative to establishment Washington and the mainstream press on the most important issues of our time: the Covid-19 vaccine, January 6th, the Ukraine war, even UFOs, just to name a few.His ratings -- the highest in cable news history -- spoke for themselves. But if there remained any doubt as to the esteem in which Carlson is held, not just by conservatives, but by all who feel alienated by our imperious and self-serving ruling class, it was evident in the outpouring of grief and anger that came with his abrupt firing from Fox News.Who is Tucker Carlson off camera? How did his upbringing contribute to who he is today? What motivates the man who has been (and will surely reemerge) as the most influential and, in the establishment’s eyes, the most dangerous voice in American politics and culture?Author Chadwick Moore was granted unprecedented access to Carlson’s professional and personal life. Based on hundreds of hours of interviews with Carlson, his family, colleagues, acquaintances, and enemies, Tucker offers an inside look into one of the most beloved -- and polarizing -- media figures of our time.

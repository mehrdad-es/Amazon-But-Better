Hijras: Who We Are Kindle Edition|by Ruth Lor Malloy (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|This is a booklet about the unique hijra (aka eunuch) cult in India. They are a secretive people. They worship a Mother Goddess who demands infertility of her followers. In return disciples believe she gives them the power to bless and curse. They are severely discriminated against. Many become beggars and prostitutes to survive. In 1997 Canadian Ruth Lor Malloy and a group of multifaith volunteers in Mumbai put this booklet together for the hijras to sell when they were begging. It made headlines world wide. It is an interview with a hijra guru about her society, customs, religion, ritual castration and much more.

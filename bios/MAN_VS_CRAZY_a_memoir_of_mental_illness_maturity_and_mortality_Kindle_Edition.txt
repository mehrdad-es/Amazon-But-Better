MAN VS CRAZY: a memoir of mental illness, maturity and mortality Kindle Edition|by Matthew James Elwell (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|“It’d only been a little over 18 months since I’d dared to leave the comfort of my childhood bedroom where the walls were still plastered with movie posters and action figures were lined up on the window ledge. And now, I had a front-row seat to psychosis, drug-addiction, sexual abuse, post-traumatic stress and self-harm. And that was only my personal life...”18-year-old wannabe writer Matthew finds himself washed-up on the English Riviera, forced to take up work as a carer in a low-rent Nursing Home just to keep a roof over his head. He soon crosses paths with childhood friend Roxy; a streetwise aspiring musician suffering from schizophrenia, who opens up a world of chaos and colourful characters, and convinces Matthew to take a job on a secure Psychiatric Unit. There, he quickly realises that he's traded "changing nappies and soaping up old people's saggy bits" for a daily onslaught of abuse, restraints and genuine insanity. But when he falls into a relationship with ex-patient Laura, a single-mum with a troubled past, things really do start to get crazy.Always bitingly honest, sometimes darkly funny and occasionally tragic, “Man vs Crazy” is a coming of age memoir about the true price of the often traumatic journey into adulthood.

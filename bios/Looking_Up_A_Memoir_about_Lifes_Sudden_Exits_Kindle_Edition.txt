Looking Up: A Memoir about Life's Sudden Exits Kindle Edition|by Casey Roman (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|Losing her TV news career and her home in the same year wasn’t on Casey Roman’s 2018 Bingo card. Neither was sleeping in Walmart parking lots and nearly deciding to end her own life. But the world is full of blind curves, and salvation comes in unusual forms, like a cargo van. What began as a three-week road trip to erase her “news lady” image became a 12,000-mile solo journey that saved Casey’s life.Looking Up is a riches-to-rags-to-rebellion memoir that reads like a love letter to small-town America. Hop in the passenger’s seat and ride along for encounters that are sometimes scary and often hilarious, from rapping in the “Murder Capital of the US” to luring a moose with a bag of bread in Maine. For anyone looking for direction who feels like they’re running on empty, Casey Roman’s story is a reminder to keep driving toward the horizon, no matter what. Hope is out there.

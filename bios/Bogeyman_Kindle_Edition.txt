Bogeyman Kindle Edition|by Steve Jackson (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|The New York Times bestselling author “gives a master class on true crime reporting in Bogeyman. He writes with both muscle and heart” (Gregg Olsen, #1 New York Times bestselling author). Bogeyman describes in dramatic detail and with heartrending poignancy the efforts of tenacious Texas lawmen to solve the cold case murders of three little girls and hold serial child killer David Elliot Penton accountable for his horrific crimes. From the book: “For years he’d stalked elementary schools and playground looking for young girls from low-income neighborhoods to abduct, rape and murder. He thought of them as ‘throwaway kids’—hardly missed, and soon forgotten, except by those who loved them. He was every parent’s worst nightmare. The bogeyman they warned their children about . . . the fiend who lurked outside bedroom windows.”“Absorbing and haunting! Bogeyman spills creepily across the page with Steve Jackson’s hellacious verve and insight, reminding us there are few better explorers of the American berserk.”—Ron Franscell, bestselling author of Alice & Gerald: A Homicidal Love Story“Steve Jackson’s latest, Bogeyman, reveals a living, breathing nightmare that haunted parents, as well as detectives. Be sure to add it to your reading list if you’re a fan of true crime books.”—Aaron Habel, host of Generation Why Podcast “There are true crime books that just lay out the facts, and there are true crime books that pull you deeply into a world. Jackson writes deeply . . . It’s all in Bogeyman, a fascinating, well-paced read about the lows and highs of cold case investigations.”—Katherine Ramsland, bestselling author and professor of forensic psychology, in Psychology Today

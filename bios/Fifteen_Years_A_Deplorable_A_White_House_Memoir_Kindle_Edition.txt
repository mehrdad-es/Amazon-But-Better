Fifteen Years A Deplorable: A White House Memoir Kindle Edition|by Mike McCormick (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|Finally, a White House tell-all turns the tables on the “swamp” and outlines the genius of President Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign!Pulling no punches, former White House stenographer Mike McCormick describes with eyewitness precision why Donald Trump’s hard-earned 2016 election was the result of MAGA Americans’ disgust with the ineptitude of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton’s and the do-nothing Democrats.Readers who demand an unbiased media will appreciate McCormick’s candor and honesty in unmasking offending “journalists” at CNN, NBC, CBS, and other organizations who behave differently off-camera than they do on-camera.Sick of hearing about White House misconduct? McCormick’s account reveals it’s journalists who are committing acts of racism, hate, and dishonesty.The Obama White House was a pernicious environment for a Trump supporter, so McCormick stayed below the radar until an inadvertent slip-up among colleagues at the outset of our now vicious “cancel culture” cost him dearly. But with his unique Obama White House insider’s perspective, McCormick dissects the 2016 election with month-to-month descriptions of Donald Trump’s amazing march to the presidency!There are never-before-reported anecdotes on Hillary Clinton’s indefensibly poor campaign. Trump fans will enjoy McCormick’s firsthand accounts of how Team Obama’s many failures resulted in the election of President Donald Trump!McCormick also takes full advantage of his front-row White House vantage point spanning 15 years to generate insights into the causes for America’s current vicious political climate, as well as a novel solution.McCormick’s love of democracy and the American spirit shines through in his anecdotes of the strength and dignity of our American servicemen and servicewomen whom he met in a variety of theaters and activities, including as the co-founder of a volunteer kayak therapy program at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center from 2004 to 2007.Fair-minded Americans will appreciate McCormick’s portrayal of George W. Bush’s compassionate genius, and George H.W. Bush’s and Bill Clinton’s grace, industry, and bipartisan cooperation in the saving of millions of lives in 2005, as well as his humorous anecdotes of Michelle Obama’s zest for life, and Joe Biden’s incessant bungling.This is a book of real history, by an author who lived it -- on Air Force One, Air Force Two, in the Oval Office, the West Wing, Iraq, China, Russia, and every state in America.

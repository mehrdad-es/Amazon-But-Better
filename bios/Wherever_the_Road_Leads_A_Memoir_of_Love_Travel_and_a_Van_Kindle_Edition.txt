Wherever the Road Leads: A Memoir of Love, Travel, and a Van Kindle Edition|by K. Lang-Slattery (Author), K. Lang-Slattery (Illustrator), Thomas Slattery (Photographer) Format: Kindle Edition|A wedding, a VW microbus, and two years on the road. Newlyweds (an artist and an engineer) meet the rigors of travel and the ups and downs of married life in a Volkswagen microbus that continually needs repair. Surrounded by exotic backdrops from Panama to India and beset by mechanical problems, Tom and Katie drive 39,000 miles across four continents in a world before the internet or cell phones. Everything from engine trouble to personal sanitation, from running out of funds to primitive roads, affects their journey. Will their beloved green van make it to the end of the trip? Will their relationship thrive or will it crumble under the pressure of living together 24/7 in a van?

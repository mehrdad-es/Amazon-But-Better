Take Your Baby And Run: How nurses blew the whistle on Canadaâ€™s biggest cardiac disaster Kindle Edition|by Carol Youngson (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|Foreword by Lanette Siragusa, RN NMTake Your Baby and Run is Carol Youngson's first-hand account of the shocking ineptitude and misogynistic behaviour that led to the death of twelve children, primarily infants, under the care of Dr. Jonah Odim at Winnipeg's largest hospital in 1994. Youngson was the nurse in charge of the cardiac unit and in her book she details the dysfunctional hospital hierarchy that allowed this tragedy to unfold, leading to the longest running inquiry in Canadian history. Sadly, the themes of this book are just as relevant today during our current health crisis.

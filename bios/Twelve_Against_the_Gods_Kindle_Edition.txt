Twelve Against the Gods Kindle Edition|by William Bolitho (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|Recommended by Elon Musk as a key book that inspired him. This book is intended to elucidate history somewhat, more to illustrate it, to honor without hypocrisy the deeds of men and women whose destiny was larger, if not deeper than our own. Above all to shake loose the perception of the adventurer in us and of us in the adventurer.

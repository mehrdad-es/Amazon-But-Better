Cody a.k.a Buffalo Bill, written by his sister Helen Cody Wetmore. Buffalo Bill was of the most famous and well-known figures of the American Old West. His legend began to spread when he was only 23. Shortly thereafter he started performing in shows that displayed cowboy themes and episodes from the frontier and Indian Wars. In authors words the reason for writing this biography were twofold. Primarily, her intention was to provide an authentic biography of her brother in response to many books of varying value that have been published. The second reason was purely personal. Helen wanted to share with readers who Bill was personally and to present his true personality.Contents:The Old Homestead in IowaWill's First IndianThe Shadow of Partisan StrifePersecution ContinuesThe "Boy Extra"Family Defender and Household TeaseIndian Encounter and School-day IncidentsDeath and Burial of TurkWill as Pony Express RiderEchoes From SumterA Short but Dashing Indian CampaignThe Mother's Last IllnessIn the Secret-serviceWill as a BenedictHow the Sobriquet of "Buffalo Bill" Was WonSatanta, Chief of the KiowasWill Made Chief of ScoutsArmy Life at Fort M'phersonPa-has-ka, the Long-haired ChiefThe Hunt of the Grand Duke AlexisTheatrical ExperiencesThe Government's Indian PolicyLiterary WorkFirst Visit to the Valley of the Big HornTour of Great BritainReturn of the "Wild West" to AmericaA Tribute to General MilesThe "Wild West" at the World's FairCody Day at the Omaha ExpositionThe Last of the Great Scouts

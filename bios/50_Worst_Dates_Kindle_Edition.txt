50 Worst Dates Kindle Edition|by Jane Laboucane (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|There are bad dates—and then there are disastrous ones. Canadian author Jane Laboucane has had her fair share of both. Meet the celebrity chef with kleptomania, the financial submissive with a desire to be dominated, the tech-worker with the ability to see dead people, and many more. In this hilarious collection of vignettes, Laboucane navigates the perils of modern dating with laugh-out-loud tales of her quest to find “The One.” A refreshingly cheeky, fun-loving journey, 50 Worst Dates will make you think twice about swiping right on that good-looking guy and remind you that laughter is sometimes the best approach to love."Hysterically funny, well-written, and engaging. . .[Laboucane] shines through as a witty, kind-hearted, and fun-loving observer." - Brooke Goode, Author

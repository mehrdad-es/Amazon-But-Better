Breadsong: How Baking Changed Our Lives Kindle Edition|by Kitty Tait (Author), Al Tait (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|James Beard Awards 2023 nominee - Bread categoryShortlisted for the 2023 Andre Simon Best Cookbook AwardA cookbook full of heart that explores the redemptive power of baking.Kitty Tait grew up a funny, chatty redhead who made everyone in her family laugh. But around the time she turned 14, Kitty began experiencing anxiety. Slowly, she disconnected from everyone around her and struggled to wake up, get dressed, and leave the house. Full of worry, her parents tried everything, from new hobbies like reading and painting to medication and visits to a specialist. Nothing seemed to help.Then, one day, as Kitty stood on a stool watching her dad mix flour, water, and salt, she determined Al's gloopy, sludgy blob of bread looked a whole lot like her brain. The next day, peaking under the tea towel as the mix gently bubbled and popped, Kitty came to a stunning realization: bread is alive. Al asked Kitty if she'd like to try baking bread herself, and their lives were never the same again. One loaf quickly escalated into an obsession, and Kitty felt better than she had for a long time. Within nine months, Kitty and Al opened The Orange Bakery--and they haven't stopped since.Featuring more than 80 recipes-including cinnamon buns, cheese swirls, and tahini brownies-Breadsong is a celebration of bread and baking, and an inspiring story of the life-saving power of discovering a passion.

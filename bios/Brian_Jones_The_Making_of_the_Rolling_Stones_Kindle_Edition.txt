Brian Jones: The Making of the Rolling Stones Kindle Edition|by Paul Trynka (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|“Should be unfailingly interesting to any Stones fan.”—Larry Rhoter, New York Times The Rolling Stones’ rise to fame is one of rock ‘n’ roll’s epic stories. Yet one crucial part of that story has never been fully told: the role of Brian Jones, the visionary who founded the band and meticulously controlled their early sound, only to be dethroned by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Tormented by paranoia and drug problems, Jones drowned at the age of twenty-seven. Drawing on new information and interviews with Richards, Andrew Oldham, and Marianne Faithfull, among dozens of others, Brian Jones lays bare the Rolling Stones’ full story, in all its glory and squalor.

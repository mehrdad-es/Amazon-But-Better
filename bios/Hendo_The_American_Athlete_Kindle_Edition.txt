With his trademark humor, he sheds light on his two trips to the Olympics, his transformative time training in Europe and Russia, and his up-and-down relationship with Dana White.Hendo: The American Athlete is a thrilling window into the life and mind of a true legend. There will never be another fighter like Hendo.

Lloyd-Jones on the Christian Life: Doctrine and Life as Fuel and Fire (Theologians on the Christian Life) Kindle Edition|by Jason C. Meyer (Author), Sinclair B. Ferguson (Foreword) Format: Kindle Edition|Called a “physician of the soul,” Martyn Lloyd-Jones is widely regarded as one of the most powerful preachers of the twentieth century. Originally trained as a medical doctor, he changed careers after recognizing the depth of healing the gospel can bring to the soul of a sinner. With a unique ability to winsomely capture the minds and hearts of his listeners, Lloyd-Jones crafted sermons that continue to have a tremendous impact on the world today, almost forty years after his death. In this book, pastor Jason Meyer summarizes what Lloyd-Jones taught about the Christian life, what he saw as the dangers of separating doctrine from life, and how he modeled devotion to the knowledge of God. Lloyd-Jones’s passion for the glory of God in his own life will encourage Christians to hunger to experience God in the same way.

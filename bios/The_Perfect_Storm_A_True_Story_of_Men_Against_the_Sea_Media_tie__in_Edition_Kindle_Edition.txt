The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea Media tie-in Edition, Kindle Edition|by Sebastian Junger (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|"There is nothing imaginary about Junger's book; it is all terrifyingly, awesomely real." —Los Angeles TimesIt was the storm of the century, boasting waves over one hundred feet high—a tempest created by so rare a combination of factors that meteorologists deemed it "the perfect storm." In a book that has become a classic, Sebastian Junger explores the history of the fishing industry, the science of storms, and the candid accounts of the people whose lives the storm touched. The Perfect Storm is a real-life thriller that makes us feel like we've been caught, helpless, in the grip of a force of nature beyond our understanding or control.Winner of the American Library Association's 1998 Alex Award.

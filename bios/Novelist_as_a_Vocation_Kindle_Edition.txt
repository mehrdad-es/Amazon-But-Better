Novelist as a Vocation Kindle Edition|by Haruki Murakami (Author), Philip Gabriel (Translator), Ted Goossen (Translator) Format: Kindle Edition|A charmingly idiosyncratic look at writing, creativity, and the author’s own novels, from the beloved and best-selling author of1Q84 and Norwegian Wood.In this engaging book, the internationallybest-selling author and famously private writer Haruki Murakami shares with readers his thoughts on the role of the novel in our society; his own origins as a writer; and his musings on the sparks of creativity that inspire other writers, artists, and musicians. Here are the personal details of a life devoted to craft: the initial moment at a Yakult Swallows baseball game, when he suddenly knew he could write a novel; the importance of memory, what he calls a writer’s “mental chest of drawers”; the necessity of loneliness, patience, and his daily running routine; the seminal role a carrier pigeon played in his career. Readers who have long wondered where the mysterious novelist gets his ideas and what inspires his strangely surreal worlds will be fascinated by this insightful and unique look at the craft of writing and into the mind of a master storyteller.

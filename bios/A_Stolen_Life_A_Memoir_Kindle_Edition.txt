A Stolen Life: A Memoir Kindle Edition|by Jaycee Lee Dugard (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|In the summer of 1991 I was a normal kid. I did normal things. I had friends and a mother who loved me. I was just like you. Until the day my life was stolen.For eighteen years I was a prisoner. I was an object for someone to use and abuse.For eighteen years I was not allowed to speak my own name. I became a mother and was forced to be a sister. For eighteen years I survived an impossible situation.On August 26, 2009, I took my name back. My name is Jaycee Lee Dugard. I don’t think of myself as a victim. I survived.A Stolen Life is my story—in my own words, in my own way, exactly as I remember it.---The pine cone is a symbol that represents the seed of a new beginning for me. To help facilitate new beginnings, with the support of animal-assisted therapy, the J A Y C Foundation provides support and services for the timely treatment of families recovering from abduction and the aftermath of traumatic experiences—families like my own who need to learn how to heal. In addition, the J A Y C Foundation hopes to facilitate awareness in schools about the important need to care for one another.Our motto is “Just Ask Yourself to . . . Care!”A portion of my proceeds from this memoir will be donated to The J A Y C Foundation Inc.

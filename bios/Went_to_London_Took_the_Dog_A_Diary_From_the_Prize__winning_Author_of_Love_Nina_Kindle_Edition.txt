Went to London, Took the Dog: A Diary: From the Prize-winning Author of Love, Nina Kindle Edition|by Nina Stibbe (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|'Painfully funny, but also deeply moving' - Meg Mason'Vulnerable, sharp, funny, wise' - Bonnie Garmus'A unique comic voice, endlessly funny' - David NichollsTwenty years after leaving London, Nina Stibbe is back in town with her dog, Peggy. Together they take up lodging in the house of writer Deborah (Debby) Moggach in Camden for 'a year-long sabbatical'. It’s a break from married life back in Cornwall, or even perhaps a fresh start altogether.Debby does not have many demands – only to water the garden, watch for toads, and defrost the odd pie – so Nina is free to explore the city she once called home. Between scrutinising her son’s online dating developments, navigating the politics of the local pool, and taking detergent advice at the laundrette, this diary of a sixty-year-old runaway reunites us with the inimitable voice of Love, Nina, as the writer becomes, as she puts it, 'a proper adult' at last.As heard on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour'An utter, UTTER treat! It was like spending time with my most clever, insightful, funny, FUNNY friend' - Marian Keyes'No one writes heartbreak more hilariously, or hilarity more heartbreakingly' - Katherine Heiny'So sharp and funny, blissfully gossipy, enviably well-observed . . . I loved it' - India Knight

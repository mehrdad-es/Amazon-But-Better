Some Sex and a Hill: or How to Learn Welsh in 3 Easy Pints Kindle Edition|by Aran Jones (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|"Read the first bit, pissed myself laughing, bought it, now hooked."Ingi Birchell Hughes, @1ngi or @serenloft***Aran Jones wrote the course for the popular online Welsh learning system SaySomethinginWelsh.com, and with his close friend Iestyn ap Dafydd he co-founded SaySomethingin.com Ltd.Tens of thousands of Welsh learners have used SaySomethinginWelsh as part of their journey towards speaking Welsh.This irreverent (and often downright impolite) book is the story of how Aran himself learnt Welsh.It involves parties, bad jokes about sex, broken hearts, alcohol, tactical mistakes, moments of joy, tattoos and all the raw humiliation of embarrassing yourself in public - not just once, but over and over again. Some of the painful moments here will be immediately recognisable to all Welsh learners - others might strike them as unnecessary and self-inflicted.If you're looking for a calm and thoughtful analysis of different ways to learn Welsh, this is very much NOT the right book for you.If, on the other hand, you want evidence that Aran has suffered as much as you have at the hands of the Welsh language, and possibly humiliated himself even more (drunken charades, anyone?) then you're in exactly the right place.

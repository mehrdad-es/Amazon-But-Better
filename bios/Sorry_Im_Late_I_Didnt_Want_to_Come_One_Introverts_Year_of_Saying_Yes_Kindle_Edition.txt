Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want to Come: One Introvert's Year of Saying Yes Kindle Edition|by Jessica Pan (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|An introvert spends a year trying to live like an extrovert with hilarious results and advice for readers along the way.What would happen if a shy introvert lived like a gregarious extrovert for one year? If she knowingly and willingly put herself in perilous social situations that she’d normally avoid at all costs? Writer Jessica Pan intends to find out. With the help of various extrovert mentors, Jessica sets up a series of personal challenges (talk to strangers, perform stand-up comedy, host a dinner party, travel alone, make friends on the road, and much, much worse) to explore whether living like an extrovert can teach her lessons that might improve the quality of her life. Chronicling the author’s hilarious and painful year of misadventures, this book explores what happens when one introvert fights her natural tendencies, takes the plunge, and tries (and sometimes fails) to be a little bit braver.“This book is a rollicking, hilarious delight. Jessica Pan’s sense of humor as she stumbles (and sometimes triumphs) in a world of extroverts is sure to appeal to introverts everywhere. The only downside is that her book about going out and meeting new people is sure to make you stay home until you finish it.” —Jennifer Wright, author of Get Well Soon and Killer Fashion“Charming. Brave. Hilariously honest. Whether you buy this book for yourself, your favorite introvert, or the chatty friend you’re hoping to shut up for a few solid hours, you can’t go wrong with Jessica Pan’s revealing and delightful memoir.” —David Litt, New York Times–bestselling author of Thanks, Obama

Igor I. Sikorsky: Big Dreams, Big Planes, and the Rise of Helicopters (Titans of Fortune) Kindle Edition|by Daniel Alef (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|Igor Sikorsky's name will always be associated with the evolution of the helicopter, but his story is of much greater scope; it is the story of a young Russian immigrant who came to the United States and changed the world we live in--the classical American success story. Although who built the first practical helicopter is debatable, Sikorsky's imprint on the world of helicopters is unmatched. But before helicopters, Sikorsky was the first aviation pioneer to build large multi-engine airplanes, beginning with the "Grand," a four-engine behemoth in 1912. Award-winning author Daniel Alef tells the remarkable story of Sikorsky's work in Russia, his escape to America, and the development of the helicopter.

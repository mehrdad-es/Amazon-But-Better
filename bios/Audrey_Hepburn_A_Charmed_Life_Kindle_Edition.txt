Audrey Hepburn: A Charmed Life Kindle Edition|by Robyn Karney (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|A sumptuous book which will delight idolaters of high fashion and movie stardom.” Times Literary SupplementAudrey Hepburn is a sumptuous celebration of Hepburn as a beloved fashion icon and actress. Karney tells the story of Hepburn’s life, from her childhood in Nazi-occupied Holland, through her early aspirations to become a ballet dancer, the instant and universal acclaim of her onscreen debut and her years as one of Hollywood’s most sought-after stars, to her later life working among the poorest children of the Third World. Karney’s book gives fans a rare view into the life of a beloved star.Hepburn’s acting career began after a series of minor revue and film roles in London. Hepburn was spotted by the writer Colette, who immediately cast her in the central role of a Broadway adaptation of her story, Gigi. Soon afterwards, Hepburn was offered a role alongside Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday, for which she collected an Oscar for Best Actress. The book highlights all her success that followed: she won the Tony Award for Best Actress for Ondine, captivated audiences as Natasha in War and Peace, and was highly praised for her brilliance in a serious role in The Nun’s Story. Hepburn’s style was perfection, and her clothesmany of them designed by Givenchy, who dressed her for Funny Face in 1957placed her on the world’s Best-Dressed Women list for several consecutive years. Her personality and sensuous yet untouchable beauty made her irresistible to the public. On Hepburn’s death, Liz Taylor said, God has a most beautiful new angel now that will know just what to do in heaven.”Skyhorse Publishing, along with our Arcade, Good Books, Sports Publishing, and Yucca imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs.

Behind the Mask: A Revealing Look at Twelve of the Greatest Goalies in Hockey History Kindle Edition|by Randi Druzin (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|A perfect gift for the goalie or hockey fan in your life, this collection from a bestselling sports journalist profiles hockey's legendary goalies, on and off the ice—including Carey Price, Marc-André Fleury, Roberto Luongo, and Henrik Lundqvist.“Hockey goaltenders have forever been thought of as unique, eccentric, weird and wacky. Also misunderstood. Randi Druzin’s Behind the Mask is a fascinating examination of a dozen of those who have played the position at the highest levels. This well-researched and well-written book is revealing and delightful at the same time.”—Roy MacGregorWhile his teammates rush up the ice in a coordinated attack, the goalie is alone in his net. And when the play turns back toward him, he's prepared to step in front of a frozen rubber disc traveling 100 miles an hour. He's the last line of defense in a pitched battle. The goalie stands apart, on and off the ice. Like the relief pitcher in baseball and the place kicker in football, he is a maverick.Behind the Mask profiles 12 legendary NHL goalies, emphasizing the traits that make each one unique. It blends accounts of the goalies on-ice exploits with anecdotes about their lives off the ice information gleaned from archival research as well as interviews with teammates, family members and the goalies themselves.The careers here cover the last half-century of professional hockey from the personal struggles of Roger Crozier and Ed Giacomin on their way to stardom in the 1960s, to the recent brilliance of Carey Price, whose character blends stoicism with a deep warmth and pride in his Indigenous background.Told with author Randi Druzin’s trademark mix of knowledge and wit, Behind the Mask has all the insight and color to make it a bestseller like her previous book on NHL goalies, Between the Pipes.Hockey goalies profiled include:Roger Crozier, Detroit Red Wings / Buffalo SabresRogie Vachon, Los Angeles KingsGerry Cheevers, Boston BruinsEd Giacomin, New York RangersTony Esposito, Chicago Black HawksVladislav Tretiak, Soviet Red ArmyMike Palmateer, Toronto Maple LeafsGrant Fuhr, Edmonton OilersRoberto Luongo, Vancouver CanucksMarc-André Fleury, Pittsburgh Penguins / Vegas Golden KnightsHenrik Lundqvist, New York RangersCarey Price, Montreal Canadiens

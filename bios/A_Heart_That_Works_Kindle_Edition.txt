In 2018, Rob Delaney’s two-year-old son, Henry, died of a brain tumor. A Heart That Works is Delaney’s intimate, unflinching, and at times fiercely funny exploration of Henry’s beautiful, bright life and the devastation of his loss – from the harrowing illness to the vivid, bodily impact of grief and the blind, furious rage that followed through to the forceful, unstoppable love that remains. In the madness of his grief, Delaney grapples with the fragile miracle of life, the mysteries of death, and the question of purpose for those left behind.   Profound, painful, full of emotion, and bracingly honest, Delaney’s memoir offers solace to those who have faced devastation and shows us how grace may appear even in the darkest times.

When the War Never Ends: The Voices of Military Members with PTSD and Their Families Reprint Edition, Kindle Edition|by Leah Wizelman (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|Veterans with PTSD speak: “Anyone wanting to understand what it is to have a ‘flashback’ will learn more from these firsthand accounts than from any textbook.” ―The British Journal of Psychiatry The chances of service members developing PTSD after military-related traumas is, according to a U.S. study, at least thirty percent. The effects can be devastating, ranging from distressing flashbacks to nightmares, sleep disorders, physical symptoms, irritability, aggressions, and memory and concentration problems. These symptoms often cause severe impairment in all areas of life and may lead to despair and hopelessness. PTSD is neither a localized nor a temporary problem.  Here, Leah Wizelman relates the true stories of service members from different service branches and ranks from the United States, Canada, Australia, and Germany, who were participants in various wars (Vietnam, Gulf War, Iraq, Afghanistan, Grenada) and peace missions (Kosovo, Bosnia, Croatia, Cambodia, Somalia, Cyprus, Haiti). They talk openly about their lives after trauma and share their fates with the reader. Spouses of affected military members also tell their stories. They talk about the challenges loved ones face when living with a partner with PTSD, how it affects their children, and how they manage to cope.  As these stories show all too vividly, military-related PTSD has not been dealt with effectively or with enough empathy or sympathy. Those affected by PTSD will realize that they are not alone in their suffering—and others will gain insight into the realities of this challenging disorder. “I highly recommend this volume to all who seek to understand combat-related PTSD.” —Kathryn M. Magruder, MPH., PhD, Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Military Science Division, Medical University of South Carolina

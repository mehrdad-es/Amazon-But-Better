(His chapter on a Mosquito raid to Berlin is so detailed that one feels being with him in the cockpit!)He returned at the end of the war, knighted with Holland’s highest military order by Wilhelmina, the Queen of the Netherlands. As her post-war ADC he brings one into her daily life with its challenges and surprises.‘Soldier of Orange’ is a riveting story. Its focus is on choices in time of war. Acts of heroism, friendship, and deceit form the fate of his early fellow students and war-time comrades.Includes photographs from the original edition, published in 1980!(Those wanting to know more of Erik Hazelhoff’s entire life (“a hundred lives’” according to Len Deighton) should look for ‘Win A Few’, his autobiography from birth in Java, through international intrigues and American adventures, to his final resting place at 90, in Hawaii)

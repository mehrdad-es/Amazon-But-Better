Ice and Bone: Tracking an Alaskan Serial Killer Kindle Edition|by Monte Francis (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|“A chilling chronicle of victims brutally murdered by a cold, merciless killer, against a backdrop equally as unforgiving—the Last Frontier” (Henry Lee, author of Presumed Dead). On a clear, brisk night in September of 2000, thirty-three-year-old Della Brown was found sexually assaulted and beaten to death inside a filthy, abandoned shed in seedy part of Anchorage, Alaska. She was one of six women, mostly Native Alaskan, slain that year, stoking fears a serial killer was on the loose. A tanned and thuggish twenty-year-old would eventually implicate himself in three of the women’s deaths and confess, in detail, to Della’s murder. Yet, after a three-month trial, Joshua Wade would walk free. In 2007, when Wade kidnapped a well-loved nurse psychologist from her home and then executed her in the remote wilderness of Wasilla, two astute female detectives joined forces to finally bring him to justice. Ice and Bone is the chilling true account of how a demented murderer initially evaded police and avoided conviction only to slip back into the shadows and kill again. Journalist and writer Monte Francis tells the harrowing story of what eventually led to Wade’s capture, and reveals why the true scope of his murderous rampage is only now, more than a decade later, coming into view. “A tremendous amount of exceptional journalistic work went into this, and the book that emerges is richly detailed and deeply sensitive toward the victims and those who loved them. And while in no way forgiving to Wade, Francis seeks to locate the human deep inside him that went terribly wrong, apparently from a very young age.” —Alaska Dispatch

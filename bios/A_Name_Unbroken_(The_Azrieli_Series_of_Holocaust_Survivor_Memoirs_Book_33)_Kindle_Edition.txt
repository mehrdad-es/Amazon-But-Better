Recruited into forced labour, sent to a ghetto and, ultimately, to the Nazi camps of Auschwitz and MÃ¼hldorf, Miklos never stopped fighting to change his fate. After the war, he risked everything in order to leave his past behind. Decades later, a chance meeting in Toronto led Miklos, now Michael Mason, to discover the power of his new name.

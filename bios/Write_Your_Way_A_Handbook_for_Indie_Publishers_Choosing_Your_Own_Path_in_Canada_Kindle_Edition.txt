Write Your Way: A Handbook for Indie Publishers: Choosing Your Own Path in Canada Kindle Edition|by Sarah Butland (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|When you're a writer with the desire to become an author, the options can be confusing, overwhelming and time-consuming. Pitching your story to a publisher is like handing them the heart you took such great care in developing, waiting to be judged and accepted. Rejections are part of the publishing world, how you handle them is a journey of practice and patience.A lot of teachers encourage emerging authors to write what they know, so this is my example of doing just that. Being the indie author of fifteen books (sixteen if we include this one), with one published by a small press and plenty of experience in pitching, this is my answer to the common questions I've been asked through the years.My expertise is my own experiences, through what has worked and what hasn't, in hopes that I can teach you some things, connect with you and learn from you. Included are quotes from others who have chosen a more independent route through publishing and tips to encourage you to try.

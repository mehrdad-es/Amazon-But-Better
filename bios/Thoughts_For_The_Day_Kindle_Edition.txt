Thoughts For The Day Kindle Edition|by Charles Handy (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|Charles Handy may well be Britain's only world-class management guru (Director Magazine) but his thoughts about organisations and the role of the individual involve thoughts beyond pay and display. For five years, Handy delivered a series of Thoughts for the Radio 4 Today Programme which addressed spiritual issues. These were collected in a volume called Waiting for the Mountain to Move, originally published in 1991. The distilled essence of Handy's meditations and advice are published now in a new, small Little Book of Calm format, in two colours and with b&w illustrations. 'My concern is only to point to what I see as the meaning in things and to the ultimate purpose in life in order to encourage other people to find their meaning and their purpose' Charles Handy

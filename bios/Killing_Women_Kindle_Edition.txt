Killing Women Kindle Edition|by Rod Sadler (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|This true crime biography reveals the disturbing story of a serial killer who terrorized central Michigan—and now has a chance to go free. As a former youth pastor who attended the Michigan State University School of Criminal Justice, Don Miller seemed like a decent young man. But in 1978, he was arrested for the attempted murder of two teenagers. Police soon connected Miller to the disappearances of four women. In exchange for a controversial plea bargain, he led police to the missing women’s bodies. Now, thanks to the deal he was offered and changes to Michigan law, Miller is allowed to seek parole once a year. In Killing Women, author Rodney Sadler examines the crimes, the “justice” meted out, and the possibility that Miller could be unleashed on the world once again.

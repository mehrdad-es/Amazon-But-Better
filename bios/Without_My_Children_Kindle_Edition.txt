Without My Children Kindle Edition|by Sonia Lamarche (Author) Format: Kindle Edition|Without my Children is a memoir about motherhood - without easy answers or happy endings. While recovering from severe post-partum depression, the breakdown of her first marriage and the toxic co-parenting relationship that ensued, Sonia tries desperately to remain a continual and healthy presence in her children's lives despite financial constraints and physical distance. Over time, she is faced with the fact that as the loving bond with her daughter grows, so does the emotional distance with her son. As she struggles to stay connected to her children while continuing to battle depression, she navigates the dark and frightening prospect of having failed as a mother.  Without My Children is a painful, honest, heartfelt journey into the shadowlands of motherhood in which Sonia begins to make peace with letting go of what she cannot control and accept her children's choices in the wake of her own difficult ones.
